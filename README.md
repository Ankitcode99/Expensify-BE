## Expensify - Expense Tracker App

This project is an expense tracker application built with Node.js and Typescript. It allows users to record their expenses, categorize them, and track their overall spending.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js and npm installed on your system.
* A code editor or IDE of your choice (Visual Studio Code, WebStorm etc.)

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Navigate to the project directory and run:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Local Development Setup

1. **Environment Variables:**

   Create a file named `.env` in the project root directory. This file will store sensitive information like database connection details.  **Note:**  Don't commit this file to version control.

   Here's an example `.env` file:

   ```
   APP_PORT=3010
   ```

   Replace the values with your actual database connection details.

2. **Start the Development Server:**

   Run the following command to start the Node.js server:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the server on port `3000` by default. You can access the application in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
